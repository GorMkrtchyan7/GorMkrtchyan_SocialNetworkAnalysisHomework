Social Network Analysis Homework

Scenario
As a member of the marketing department or a marketing agency, our objective is to identify key individuals to target within a limited budget. The dataset, connections.txt, consists of edges representing relationships. Our task is to assist the marketing specialist in determining the most impactful targets for effective resource allocation.

Tasks
1. Create a Directed Graph
Transform the provided data (connections.txt) into a directed graph, where nodes represent individuals and edges represent relationships.

2. Identify Bridges
Detect and highlight nodes that act as bridges within the network.

3. Graph Density
Calculate and display the density of the graph. Provide insights based on your observations.

4. Node Connectivity
Show nodes with the highest and lowest number of connections to understand their significance in the network.

5. Incoming and Outgoing Connections
Highlight nodes with the highest incoming and outgoing connections to identify influential individuals.

6. Centrality Measures
Display nodes with the highest closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality. Interpret the findings to understand the importance of these nodes.

7. Community Detection
Implement a community detection algorithm on the directed graph and showcase the number of communities formed.

8. Largest and Smallest Community
Highlight the largest and smallest communities. Provide insights into the structure and significance of these communities.

9. Visualization and Node Removal
Select the three largest communities and create visualizations. Remove the top 3 nodes with the highest Degree Centrality, Closeness Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and Eigenvector for each community, and visualize the changes.

10. Influencers
Identify and visualize influencers within the top 3 communities based on centrality measures.

11. Action Plan
a. Define a hypothetical business (e.g., telecom, marketing agency).
b. Specify a hypothetical marketing budget.
c. Determine a hypothetical cost per action (advertisement cost).
d. Propose a targeted approach, deciding whom to prioritize based on the network analysis findings.

Conclusion
Summarize key insights and recommendations based on the conducted social network analysis. Provide a clear action plan for the marketing strategy, considering the budget constraints and identified influencers.
